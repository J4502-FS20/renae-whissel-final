  <h1>Their Stories</h1>

<p>Maryam*, 60, is a Columbia native who suffered a broken back in the 80s and was paralyzed from the waist down for nine years after that. Now, she can walk again, but her mobility is still severely limited—arthritis has completely worn down the cartilage in her knee and she desperately needs a knee replacement, but can’t afford it.</p>
<p>Maryam was living in San Francisco and working as a psychologist until a spell of bad luck hit — she got divorced, could no longer afford her home, and then took a job in Mexico that “turned out to be a scam.” By the time Maryam escaped from an abusive home there and returned to the U.S. she had parasites, a concussion and almost no money.</p>
<p>When Maryam returned to Columbia at the beginning of 2020, she resumed her job search while staying with friends. She eventually landed a job with the University of Missouri’s psychology department, but she said it wasn’t easy.</p>
<blockquote cite="Maryam">
  “With my disability, you're not supposed to discriminate, but they do.”
</blockquote>
<p>Less than a week after she was hired, MU closed campus due to the pandemic. Two months later, she was laid off.</p>
<p>Since then, Maryam has been living off of disability payments, which she said covers her rent, but nothing else. She has some support from friends and frequents Columbia’s food banks.</p>
<blockquote cite="Maryam">
  “I have access to the tiger food pantry, which has saved my life quite literally a couple of times since lockdown began.”
</blockquote>
<p>Maryam is still looking for a job. She has asthma and is considered to be at a high risk for complications from COVID-19, so she’s looking for something she can do remotely, but the few opportunities she’s come across haven’t worked out.</p>
<blockquote cite="Maryam">
  “I haven’t had an interview in months and I keep applying, but it’ll happen someday.”
</blockquote>
<p>*Maryam requested her last name not be published because she is currently searching for a job and is concerned about potential employers seeing her story.</p>
